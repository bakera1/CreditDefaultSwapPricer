 * TFloatRate defines a floating rate. For example, a 5 year semi-annual
 * swap rate, LIBOR or a compounding rate.
 * Note that payInterval is ONLY used if rateType = JPMCDS_SIMPLE_BASIS. 
 * This setting is used to compute LIBOR and par swap rates.
 * In order to compute compounding rates, set rateType = JPMCDS_ANNUAL_BASIS (1)
 * or 2 for semi-annual compounding, etc.
 * See the documentation for JpmcdsDayCountFraction for a list of possible 
 * day count convention constants. Note that there is no difference
 * between a TFloatRate which has a payInterval *equal* to the 
 * matInterval (for the same instrument) one which has a payInterval
 * which is *greater* than the matInterval, and one which has payInterval = 0.
 * This is because the instruments *always* have a payment at maturity, 
 * and also payments at intervals of payInterval, for dates on or 
 * before the maturity date. 
 * Simple LIBOR, etc (a zero coupon rate) is expressed by making
 * the payInterval = matInterval. 
 * Note that the spread is added to the rate *AFTER* multiplying by
 * the weight. 
 * Note that the holiday file and bad day convention in the
 * TDateAdjIntvl are used to adjust dates used to compute the rate.
