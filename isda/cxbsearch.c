/*
***************************************************************************
** Searches for a long value within an array.
**
** The array can either be an array of longs, or else an array of something
** bigger than a long which has one of its elements equal to the value that
** we seek.
**
** Returns three values - the exact value (if it exists), the lower bound
** and the upper bound.
**
** The lower bound is defined as the index of the last value which is
** strictly less than the desired value.
**
** The upper bound is defined as the index of the first value which is
** strictly greater than the desired value.
**
** The exact value is the index of a value which is equal to the desired
** value.
**
** In the case that such an index cannot be found, then the value of -1
** is returned for exact and loBound, and arraySize for hiBound.
**
** The idea behind these return values is that hiBound-loBound-1 should
** give the number of exact matches in all cases, and that everything in
** the range [loBound+1, hiBound-1] inclusive should be an exact match.
**
** If the input array is not sorted in ascending order, then the output
** is undefined. No checks are performed on the order of xArray - this
** would in fact defeat the purpose of having a fast binary search if you
** are going to slow it down by doing a linear check of the inputs.
